              <h4>The art of unnatural positions</h4>
              <p>At the beginning of my freshman year of high school, I saw videos of "street ninjas" and decided that I did not want to simply wish I could be like those people in the video and I sought out the local parkour group in Houston to learn their craft. Over the next 4 years, I slowly began transitioning from training parkour outdoors to training parkour inside gymnastics gyms. At the beginning of my freshman year of college, I saw that the university had a gymnastics team and I went to them with the hopes of being allowed to train in their gym. After observing the highly motivated and close-knit team for a week, I decided to tryout for the UT gymnastics team. I have been training with the team for about 2 years and I plan to compete still rings during the competition season in my third year.</p>

                <h1>Research</h1>
                <h4>The age of (scientific) exploration</h4>
                <p>My career in research started with my enrollment in the University of Texas' Freshman Research Initiative (FRI) program. I joined a laboratory stream working with dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticles for catalysis and learned the fundamentals of a chemical and organic chemical laboratory, while also engaging in scientific writings and presentations. During my second year at university, I became a part of the clinical research team under Dr. Michael Singer and began working in data collection, writing for publications, and even structuring my own research. I believe that scientific research is the most rewarding activity since the reward is indubitably favorable for human progress, longevity, and quality of life.</p>

                <h1>Music</h1>
                <h4>The Auditory Art</h4>
                <p>My introduction to music was a hesitant one in 6th grade as I was coerced into joining orchestra (like many others) by my parents. While I resisted at first, orchestra quickly became the most anticipated part of my day. I have played violin religiously since that time 9 years ago. The most important lessons I learned, however, were not about music, but about complementary human interactions. I learned that it is vastly more fruitful to have a group of harmonious musically mediocre individuals that function together, than an uncoordinated group of exceptional individuals. I have assembled an ensemble at the University of Texas in order to keep music perpetually present in my life by performing pieces in public for universal enjoyment.</p>
